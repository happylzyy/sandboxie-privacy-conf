Privacy mode configuration for Sandboxie
====================================

Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying local & mapped drives or the Windows registry. An isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

However, the developer support certificates required for privacy mode need donation, which is a high cost for some people, so I want to write a configuration based on the source code and try to make it have a similar effect to privacy mode. 

I'll refine the privacy mode configuration as I better understand the source code. If you feel something is not working, or want to improve it, raise issues in time.

Thanks to the developers for the contribution of Sandboxie.
